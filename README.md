# Genshin-Theoretical-Max

- An attempt to practice generating permutations of possible outcomes of an in-game item.
- Used to find the maxmimum damage output of any character with a brute force approach.
- If I was a math major, I could probably figure out more optimal code using multi-variable caluculus using optimization concepts

## Created a recursive generateDistributions Function:
- returns all ways one could distribute 5 stones amongst 4 bowls
